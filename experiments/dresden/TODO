Note: v4 has nicer text, and nicer layout of extra pins, but 
 but module DOES NOT make proper contact in the sockets when it's mounted that
way up.

v3c: you have to mount it upside down, but it was planned that way, but that
way around the device actually makes contact and works!
If you're making anything else, make sure to use the upside down footprint!


v02 bugs
* avr mosi connected to ICSP 5v pin
* ICSP MOSI pin disconnected
* breakout drills are too small for regular pin headers
* board is too wide to plug into a breadboard
* dresden drills are too small for socket pins!
* samtec headers are much taller than necessary (about twice as much)
* samtec headers have much longer pins than necessary (about twice as much)

all but headers fixed for v3c.
