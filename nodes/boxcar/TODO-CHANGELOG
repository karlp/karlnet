TODO:
* add silk/copper to mark pin 1 on SWD header
* ? Different headphone jack parts, either SMD, or footprints that 
  don't need tinned slots.
* Add jumper for current measurement
* annular rings around vias and drills hits are a little tight, isolation a
  little too much
* different inductor footprint?

v3f:
* Bigger keepout for battery case drill holes
* Add header for a console uart...?
* Drills for all 0.1" headers (mrf pins, swd) get drilled at 0.8mm
  unplated.  This is too tight for regular headers.  Should be 1.0mm, to allow
  for plating on real pcbs. (RHT03 is fine, it has super thin legs...
* maybe reverse rht so it can lay down between plug jacks?

v3e:
* Changed all through hole to SMT to make it easier to assemble when milled
* Use vias rather than through hole.
* smaller resistors for 3v3 feedback divider, should hopefully prevent
  parasitics from fucking with the regulator
* use SPI1 instead of SPI2, so this will also work on C4/C6 (Low Density) devices
* Put the right decoupling caps in the right places (mostly)
