TODO:
* different inductor footprint?
  Get footprint of parts from work (was it 1206?) and use that.
* triple check pinouts of new headphone jack sockets.
* annular rings around vias and drills hits are a little tight, isolation a
  little too much
* extra holes for providing power from pins, not just from soldered battery leads.
(Look for a battery case that has pins for mounting?)

v4a:
* WONTFIX: Add jumper for current measurement (just use the battery connector)
* regular headphone jacks.  No more oversized holes for slots, but way more space.
* rereversed rht
* test points for V+, (gnd is all the general plane, no need)
* test point for rht_pwr

v3f:
* add silk/copper to mark pin 1 on SWD header
* Bigger keepout for battery case drill holes
* Add header for a console uart...?
* Drills for all 0.1" headers (mrf pins, swd) get drilled at 0.8mm
  unplated.  This is too tight for regular headers.  Should be 1.0mm, to allow
  for plating on real pcbs. (RHT03 is fine, it has super thin legs...
* reverse rht so it can lay down between plug jacks?

v3e:
* Changed all through hole to SMT to make it easier to assemble when milled
* Use vias rather than through hole.
* smaller resistors for 3v3 feedback divider, should hopefully prevent
  parasitics from fucking with the regulator
* use SPI1 instead of SPI2, so this will also work on C4/C6 (Low Density) devices
* Put the right decoupling caps in the right places (mostly)
