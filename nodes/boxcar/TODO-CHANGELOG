TODO:
* footprint for headphone jack works, but has extra holes on the plug end
  that are unneeded, and silk is wrong for outline. (so not enough space for
  humidity sensor to fit in neatly)
* jack: No need for two different sized drills either, one drill size is fine,
  same as "green" drills.
* drillsize for STLINK is too tight for regular headers.
* annular rings around vias and drills hits are a little tight, isolation a
  little too much (only matters on milled board)
* extra holes for providing power from pins, not just from soldered battery
  leads. (OR: two extra holes, also used for strain relief on leads? needs >
  1.3mm drills? maybe 1.5me?

(Look for a battery case that has pins for mounting?)

v4a:
* different inductor footprint? (using 0805, taiyo yuden part BRC2012T4R7MD)
* WONTFIX: Add jumper for current measurement (just use the battery connector)
* regular headphone jacks.  No more oversized holes for slots, but way more space.
* triple check pinouts of new headphone jack sockets.
* rereversed rht
* test points for V+, (gnd is all the general plane, no need)
* test point for rht_pwr

v3f:
* add silk/copper to mark pin 1 on SWD header
* Bigger keepout for battery case drill holes
* Add header for a console uart...?
* Drills for all 0.1" headers (mrf pins, swd) get drilled at 0.8mm
  unplated.  This is too tight for regular headers.  Should be 1.0mm, to allow
  for plating on real pcbs. (RHT03 is fine, it has super thin legs...
* reverse rht so it can lay down between plug jacks?

v3e:
* Changed all through hole to SMT to make it easier to assemble when milled
* Use vias rather than through hole.
* smaller resistors for 3v3 feedback divider, should hopefully prevent
  parasitics from fucking with the regulator
* use SPI1 instead of SPI2, so this will also work on C4/C6 (Low Density) devices
* Put the right decoupling caps in the right places (mostly)
