TODO:
* add silk/copper to mark pin 1 on SWD header
* ? Bigger keepout for battery case drill holes
* ? Different headphone jack parts, either SMD, or footprints that 
  don't need tinned slots.
* Drills for all 0.1" headers (mrf pins, swd and rht03) get drilled at 0.8mm
  unplated.  This is too tight for regular headers.  Should be 1.0mm, to allow
  for plating on real pcbs.
* annular rings around vias and drills hits are a little tight, isolation a
  little too much

v3e:
* Changed all through hole to SMT to make it easier to assemble when milled
* Use vias rather than through hole.
* smaller resistors for 3v3 feedback divider, should hopefully prevent
  parasitics from fucking with the regulator
* use SPI1 instead of SPI2, so this will also work on C4/C6 (Low Density) devices
* Put the right decoupling caps in the right places (mostly)
